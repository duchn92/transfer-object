## Neural Re-rendering of Humans from a Single Image

[Paper](http://gvv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/NHRR/data/1415.pdf)

The code was implemented for the **Garment Transfer** obejctive, where top cloth of the source image was rendered on the target image.

**The improvement of the code with the hyper-parameter tunings are under process.
The inferenece code with better results will be updated soon.**
